# **Deep Good Air Initiative**

### We propose a novel approach using Artificial Intelligence, to create smart city designs that exploits the potential of trees to reduce the air pollution and increase the health of people around the globe.

We proposed an automatic system to scan the city landscape and generate a design of trees that reduces de effects of air pollution using Deep Neural Networks with TensorFlow.

* Using satellite images and Convolutional Neural Networks we aim to reconstruct the city landscape.
* Combining the reconstructed landscape together with  with the pollution levels,  historical data and weather we build a dataset to train a model to predict pollution levels in cities.
* Using the trained model we aim to predict which trees configurations are best suitable to lower pollution levels in desired areas.
* Following the predictions of our model we aim to be able generate urban policies to plant trees. This will finally lead to a healthier air, a better life quality and a happier community.

#### Our approach can be trained and customized for any city landscape providing a flexible, easy-to-implement and cheap approach to reduce air pollution and improve the health of people.


<!---
* Studies show that ...
* Using tensorflow to train a deep neural network model to predict pollution levels given a tree planting schema over a city.
	* First, transform satelite images in 3d reconstruction space of a city or a land.
	* Second, using data of pollution levels of certain zones train a model to predict the pollution given a tree distribution and a architectural sourounding.
	* Using papers information generate greedy optimal solutions and evaluate pollution levels.
	* Find better solutions.
